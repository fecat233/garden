## note
The inspiration for this theme comes from [CJ R.](https://github.com/w3cj)'s channel [Coding Garden with CJ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLNgu_OupwoeESgtab33CCw) on Youtube. I learned a lot from CJ's video. CJ's video always surprises me. I like the sound of his keyboard hitting and the terminal theme he uses. I think this theme is great, so I also wrote a Such a theme.
